        <h4>About</h4>
        <p class="size-large">
            Hi, I’m Shivam—a tech enthusiast with a passion for building and designing cool stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether it’s developing websites, crafting user-friendly interfaces, or experimenting with new technologies, I’m always up for a challenge.</p>
        <p>
            I enjoy working across different domains, from web development to UI/UX design, and even diving into animation and AI. My curiosity keeps me constantly learning and exploring new skills. I’ve worked on projects ranging from education platforms and automation tools to my own website generator, SiteSculpture.        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond tech, I’m a big fan of music, travel, and photography. I love creating things, whether it’s a new app, a fun animation, or just an interesting idea that pops into my head. I believe in hands-on learning, collaboration, and making things that actually solve problems.        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I’m studying Computer Science with a minor in Animation. I also freelance on the side, taking up projects that excite me.</p>
        <p>
